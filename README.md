# AlephEfes

ðŸ„°ðŸ„° Hebrew Isopsephy â€“ reproducible code and data for numeric-semantic analysis of the Hebrew Bible (isopsephy, digital-root tools, null-model tests).

## Aleph Code Calculator

A simple browser-based React application is included in this repository to explore the Aleph-Code numerology system. The app lives in `index.html` and can be opened directly in any modern browser.

### Running Locally

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. From the repository directory start a small HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.

The application loads React, ReactDOM, Babel and TailwindCSS from public CDNs, so an internet connection is required when first opening the page.
